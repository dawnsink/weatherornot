# weatherornot
This is my first stab at using an API outside of the p5.js web editor. My idea was to make a simple interface that aggreates the weather from https://openweathermap.org/ and allows users to enter a city and get the weather by pushing a button. 

This site can easily run in any modern browser. 

I was inspired by http://weathergradient.com/
